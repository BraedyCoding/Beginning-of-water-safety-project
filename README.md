# Beginning-of-water-safety-project
This is the beginning of our water safety project. As of now, the maps feature is the only thing to work. We are working on implementing a better api for the wild life images, however, due to limited funds, it is hard to find one that is free. We have also worked on some PHP and SQL script that will allow users to sign in using a SQL data base.
